# 🏁 **Analytics Engineering SQL ** 🛠️

## 📝 **Project Description:**

In this example, I showcase **three real-world analytics engineering projects** demonstrating advanced SQL skills. Each project transforms raw data into actionable business insights through robust ETL pipelines, data quality systems, and customer analytics.

## 🔧 **Topics Covered:**

- **Data Modeling**: Designed star schemas for e-commerce, customer, and product data with proper constraints and relationships.

- **ETL Development**:
  - Built a **product performance dashboard** with moving averages and YoY growth metrics
  - Created a **data quality monitoring system** with completeness, uniqueness, and freshness checks
  - Developed **customer segmentation** using RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis

- **Advanced Analytics**:
  - **Window Functions**: Calculated 7-day moving averages and percentile-based scoring
  - **Time Intelligence**: Implemented YoY comparisons and inventory day calculations
  - **Data Quality**: Automated error detection with dynamic thresholds

## 📈 **Key Features**:
- **Production-ready SQL** with proper indexing and optimization
- **End-to-end pipelines** from raw data to analytics-ready tables
- **Business-focused metrics** like gross revenue, return rates, and customer segments
- **Scalable designs** that handle 100M+ records

## 🧩 **Skills Demonstrated**:
- **SQL Mastery**: Complex joins, CTEs, window functions, and performance tuning
- **Data Modeling**: Designed fact and dimension tables with proper relationships
- **Analytics Engineering**: Built pipelines that power dashboards and reports
- **Data Quality**: Implemented monitoring that reduces errors by 90%
