# 🏁 **Lewis Hamilton 2023 Silverstone Performance Analysis** 🚗

## 📝 **Project Description:**

In this project, I analyze **Lewis Hamilton’s performance** during the **2023 British Grand Prix** at **Silverstone**. Using **FastF1**, I retrieved and visualized key data such as race positions, lap times, and race performance across the session.

## 🔧 **Topics Covered:**

- **Data Acquisition**: Using `fastf1` to retrieve historical F1 race data, specifically focusing on the 2023 season and the British Grand Prix (Silverstone).
  
- **Data Filtering**: Filtering race results to focus on **Lewis Hamilton’s performance** by extracting his race data through driver abbreviation `HAM`.

- **Visualization**:
  - **Race Position Analysis**: Visualizing Hamilton’s finishing position over the race to track his performance relative to other drivers.
  - **Lap Time Consistency**: Plotting Hamilton’s lap times across the race to analyze his consistency and compare his lap-by-lap performance.

- **Performance Insights**:
  - Understanding **Hamilton’s consistency** throughout the race.
  - Evaluating his **final race result** and **points earned**.

## 📈 **Key Features**:
- **FastF1** data handling for detailed F1 telemetry.
- **Matplotlib & Pandas** for visualizations and data analysis.
- Focus on **lap-by-lap data** for deep performance analysis.

## 🧩 **Skills Demonstrated**:
- **Data Analysis**: Working with large datasets (F1 race data) and filtering by relevant criteria.
- **Visualization**: Creating clear, insightful visualizations of Hamilton’s race performance.
- **Python Programming**: Leveraging libraries such as `FastF1`, `Matplotlib`, `Pandas`, and `Seaborn`.
